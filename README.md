# LWE-PEKS

A revised LWE-PEKS based on [https://github.com/Raycrypto/Multi-writer-PEKS](https://github.com/Raycrypto/Multi-writer-PEKS) with LLL algorithm computing shortest vectors, which can be run to simulate the time consumption of the LWE-PEKS algorithm. 

Please note that this is only a simulation testing the time consumption of each operation. There is no required order in running each ```test*.m```.
