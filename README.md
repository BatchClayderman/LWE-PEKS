# LWE-PEKS

This is a fixed LWE-PEKS based on [https://github.com/Raycrypto/Multi-writer-PEKS](https://github.com/Raycrypto/Multi-writer-PEKS) with the LLL algorithm computing shortest vectors, which can be run to simulate the time consumption of the LWE-PEKS algorithm. 

This repository is a part of the [cryptography schemes](https://github.com/BatchClayderman/Cryptography-Schemes). 

Please note that this is **only** a simulation testing the time consumption of each operation. There are **no running order requirements** in running each ```test*.m```.
